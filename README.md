# LatinSquareGen

Easy-to-use software for calculating and counting the number of Latin squares in the user's given order, this program can perform any order without computational limitations.

# What is Latin square?

In combinatorics and in experimental design, a Latin square is an n Ã— n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.


## 7th International Conference on Combinatorics, Cryptography, Computer Science and Computation

The 7th International Conference on Combinatorics, Cryptography, Computer Science and Computation (I4C2022) will be held in the School of Mathematics at Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran 2022. Original research papers in the areas of algorithms, theory of computation, computational complexity, and combinatorics related to computing are solicited. In addition to theoretical results, we are particularly interested in submissions that report on experimental and applied research of general algorithmic interest. Special consideration will be given to research that is motivated by real-world problems. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the algorithms discussed in a practical setting.
